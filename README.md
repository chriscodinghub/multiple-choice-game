## Welcome to my pw-generator!
My name is Chris Davis and this is my Multiple-Choice Game!



## I would like to start with a list of things I learned on this project.
<ul>
    <li>I learned how to create elements tied to the parent body through javascript</li> 
    <li>I learned how to create eventlisteners to elements within the HTML.</li>
    <li>I learned how to create a function and make it call other functions</li>
    <li>I learned how to use the setInterval function and to subtract/add time with live updates.</li>
    <li>I learned how to upload userInput to log data within local storage</li>
</ul>

## Functions of my App
<ul>
    <li>When you open the page, you will be prompted to test your knowledge.</li>
    <li>You will then be asked 5 multiple choice questions.</li>
    <li>Correct answers give 10 points, while wrong answers give -10seconds on your time limit.</li>
    <li>Once complete with the 5 questions, you will be prompted to sumbit your name for the scoreboard.</li>
    <li>You will then find your score recorded within your local storage.</li>
</ul>

## Future improvements/updates
<ul>
    <li>Instead of writing each line of code, I would like to create an index that auto generates the questions from and array.</li>
